# Development Notes

## Testing the Application

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   ./dev_server.py
   ```

2. **Test the diff functionality:**
   - View the sample requirements at http://localhost:5000
   - Click "View Changes" on requirements with history (ID 1 and 3)
   - Test the side-by-side diff modal
   - Notice the red/green highlighting in the unified diff

3. **Create new requirements:**
   - Click "New Requirement"
   - Fill out the form and submit
   - Edit the requirement to see history tracking

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **Diff Visualization**: Each requirement card shows a dropdown with version history. Clicking any version opens a modal with:
- Side-by-side comparison (previous vs current)
- Unified diff with red/green highlighting
- Timestamp information

✅ **HTMX Integration**: All interactions are handled via HTMX for smooth UX:
- Form submissions
- Navigation
- Modal loading
- Dynamic content updates

✅ **DaisyUI Styling**: Modern, accessible UI components:
- Cards for requirements
- Badges for priority/status
- Responsive navigation
- Modal dialogs
- Form controls

✅ **Version History**: Automatic version tracking:
- Previous versions saved to history array
- Timestamps preserved
- Full content snapshots

## Architecture Notes

- **Backend**: Pure Flask with minimal dependencies (only docopt for CLI)
- **Frontend**: HTMX + TailwindCSS + DaisyUI (no JavaScript frameworks)
- **Storage**: Simple JSON file (easily replaceable with database later)
- **Diff Engine**: Python's built-in difflib with HTML formatting

The application is production-ready for small to medium teams and can be easily extended with additional features.
